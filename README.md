# TypeScript 5 Fundamentals

The project relates to [TypeScript 5 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-5-fundamentals/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course by [Brice Wilson](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/brice-wilson).

Program is executed from the command line:

- install Node.JS and TS (e.g. globally)
- open terminal of your choice, navigate to project folder and run `tsc --outDir js app.ts` command to compile the app (repeat manually)
- open second terminal and go to `js` folder, run `node app.js` command to run the app

If you want to run the project in _watch mode_ (the compile will automatically recompile the code any time the source file is saved) run in the root directory `tsc --outDir js --watch app.ts` command.
